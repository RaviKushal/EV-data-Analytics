# EV Diagnostics & Performance Analytics (SQL + Power BI)

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview
This project simulates data analytics for electric vehicle (EV) diagnostics, built using SQL and Power BI. The objective was to transform raw EV data into meaningful insights for battery health, charging behaviour, thermal anomalies, tire health, and vehicle speed profiles.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `sql/`: Contains SQL scripts for cleaning data and creating analytical tables
- `powerbi/`: Power BI dashboard file + screenshots of key visuals

## ðŸ›  Tech
- SQL (SQLite / MySQL)
- Power BI
- (Optional) Python for mock data generation

## ðŸ“Š Key Analytical Tables
- `battery_summary`: Daily battery current, voltage, SoC, temperature stats
- `speed_analysis`: Speed averages, bands, variance
- `thermal_anomalies`: Over-temperature events
- `charging_sessions`: Charge duration, energy, SoC delta
- `tire_health_summary`: Tire pressure and temperature checks
- `gps_movement`: Valid location tracking

## ðŸ“ˆ Power BI Dashboards
- Daily battery trends
- Trip efficiency
- Tire health indicators
- Speed profiles vs SoC
- Geospatial vehicle routes

## ðŸš€ Run It
1. Run SQL scripts on your EV dataset or the provided mock data
2. Open Power BI file and connect to dataset
3. Explore the dashboards!

## ðŸ“¬ Let's Connect
I'm keen to apply these skills in EV, automotive, and data engineering roles. Reach out!
